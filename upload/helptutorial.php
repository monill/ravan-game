Searching is a vital part of the game. Initially you may only search the Streets, but as you progress in the game you will have other options opened up to you to have different outcomes.<br />

You choose your search area, and wait to see what your result is. You may find potions, weapons or armour! Of course, that's just the basic items you are able to gain; at higher levels, you will find that your searches will become more and more rewarding.<br />
<br />
You will get 25 free searches every day, and if that's not enough, you can always refill that 25 searches using 200 white crystals. Note that the searches will not carry over to the next day so you should finish them before the day is over.<br />
<br />
Take your chances of good and bad outcomes, and long term you will find yourself better off.
